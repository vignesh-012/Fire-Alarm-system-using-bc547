🔥 Fire Detection System Using BC547

👀 What is this project about?

Fire is one of the leading causes of property damage and loss of life. The Fire Detection System is designed to identify the presence of fire or smoke early and alert occupants immediately. By integrating smoke, heat, and flame sensors with a BC547 transistor-based alarm circuit, this system ensures timely warnings, enabling safe evacuation and minimizing damage.

🎯 Why we built this

To save lives by providing early fire alerts.
To protect property and reduce fire-related losses.
To offer a low-cost, scalable, and reliable solution.
To meet fire safety compliance standards for residential and commercial spaces.

⚙️ How it works

Sensor detection → Smoke, heat, or flame sensors monitor the environment.
Signal amplification → The small sensor signals are amplified by a BC547 transistor.
Alarm trigger → When fire or smoke is detected, the transistor switches the alarm circuit ON.
Alert notification → A buzzer, LED, or visual indicator notifies occupants immediately.
